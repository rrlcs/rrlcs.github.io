### Boolean Function Synthesis using Gated Continuous Logic Network
I am currently working on Boolean Function Synthesis with [Stanly Samuel](http://stanlysamuel.com/) under the advisory of Prof. Aditya Kanade, Prof. Chiranjib Bhattacharyya and Prof. Deepak D'Souza.

<!-- ## TOPICS IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING -->
### Generating Grammar Rules for Syntax-Guided Synthesis using Deep Neural Network:
This project employed Deep Learning model for restricting the solution space by predicting relevant Grammar rules. Given a Specication in the form of logical constraints for the SyGuS problem, we trained a Neural
Network (GGNN2FF) to predict the Grammar Rules required to get to the solution program. We were able to
achieve 91% accuracy. [GitHub](https://github.com/rrlcs/tse-mini-project2)


### Translating Logical Specifications into Programs using Machine Learning techniques:
In this project our aim was to discover whether the Neural Networks can understand the Semantics
of Logical Constraints or not. If it captures then, is it able to translate that into meaningful programs or not. We experimented with the Conditional Linear Integer Arithmetic track
from the SyGuS competition 2019. We modeled a GGNN for encoding the constraints and an RNN
for decoding the nal programs. We were able to get correct one length programs.
This project was done during the course Program Synthesis meets Machine Learning (Jan'20, Jun'20). I worked in this project along with [Stanly Samuel](http://stanlysamuel.com/) under the guidance of [Prof. Deepak D'Souza](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~deepakd/), [Prof. Chiranjib Bhattacharyya](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~chiru/), and [Dr. Sriram Rajamani (Microsoft)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sriram/).

### Learning in Sparse Reward Environment:
Studied what is sparse reward and how the agent learns to achieve the desired goal even with binary
rewards. In this project we implemented the Hindsight Experience Replay. We also studied with
the help of experimentation, the eect of Demonstrations. Finally, we even implemented HER for
Dynamic environments. This Project done during the course Machine Learning (Jan'20, Jun'20). I worked in this project along with Mariamma Antony(PhD), Vivek Khandelwal(Masters), and Jagriti Singh(PhD) under the guidance of [Shubham Gupta](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=Nt-tK2UAAAAJ&hl=en).
