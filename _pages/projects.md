## TOPICS IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
### Generating Grammar Rules for Syntax-Guided Synthesis using Deep Neural Network:
Conditional Linear Integer Arithmetic (CLIA) Track synthesizes function in Linear Integer Arithmetic (LIA) combined with the if-then-else construct (ite). The Specification is stated in the form of logical constraints for the SyGuS problem. Even though CVC4 solves most of the benchmark problems but the synthesis time is slow for some of the simple problems and even timeouts in some cases. In this project, we predicted the grammar rules for a given set of logical constraints to restrict the search space consequently improving the synthesis time. 


1. Synthesizing programs from SMT specification by giving it as an input to Machine Learning model
2. Learning in Sparse Reward Environment (Reinforcement Learning).
